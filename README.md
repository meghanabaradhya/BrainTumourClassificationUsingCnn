# BrainTumourClassificationUsingCnn
The data consist of only yes or no dataset and classification is performed

Steps to be followed for best results:

1.The dataset is obtained from Kaggle copa and paste the link mentioned below:

https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection


on the website click for Dowload(8MB)  

2.Extract these files and connect these files to your respective google drive before running the code.

3.After this step please read the important instructions mentioned in code for few manual steps which needs to be performed to get results.

Important note:
This project require few important libraries to be imported before executing.please do install the following libraries before running code.
These commands work on google colab(This is chosen so that code could be executed even when python environment is not installed on system.)
